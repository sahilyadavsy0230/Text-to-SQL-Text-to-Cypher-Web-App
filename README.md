Text-to-SQL & Text-to-Cypher App 🚀

This project is an AI-powered Streamlit web app that lets you query both relational (SQL) and graph (Neo4j) databases using natural language. It uses LangChain with an LLM to convert your questions into SQL or Cypher queries, executes them, and displays results interactively.

🔍 Natural Language to SQL – Ask questions and get results from a relational DB.

🕸️ Natural Language to Cypher – Query graph databases (Neo4j) easily.

📊 Interactive UI – Powered by Streamlit.

🧠 LLM-Powered Translation – Converts text → database queries.

🗄️ Supports multiple DBs – Works with SQLite (default) and Neo4j.
